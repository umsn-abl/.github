## Welcome!

This is the official GitHub page of the Applied Biostatistics Laboratory (ABL) within the University of Michigan School of Nursing.
  - On this page, you will find analyses conducted by members of the ABL in programming languages like R, SAS, Stata, and more.
  - Repositories are typically named according to the following formats:
    - **For analyses featured in journals, at conferences, etc.**: *name-location-project*, where *"name"* is the name of the principal investigator, *"location"* is the journal, conference, etc. where the analysis was featured, and *"project"* is some descriptive name identifying what the analysis is about.
    - **For general bits of code**: *abl-function-data*, where *"abl"* is fixed, *"function"* is some descriptive name identifying what the code does, and *"data"* is an optional string identifying what data the code is used for.
  - If you would like to collaborate with the ABL, please visit our webpage linked [here](https://nursing.umich.edu/research/grants-and-research-office-gro/applied-biostatistics-laboratory).
